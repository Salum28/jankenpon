# JanKenPon App

The following project was made in a Flutter course i made, and the main goals of this app were:

* Learn how to make images clickable;
* Pratice programming logic;
    * If-else; 
    * Logic operators (&& and ||);

Also, one of the app's goals was to pratice layout creation and customization.
## How the App Works

When you inicialize the app, you will see three buttons (rock, paper, scissor), when you click in one of them, a random number will be generated and the result will be the computer's choice.

After that, your choice and the computer's choice will be compared, based on the result, a text will bem shown in your screen declaring if you win, you lose or if it was a tie.
